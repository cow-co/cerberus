## Reporting a Vulnerability

I welcome reports about vulnerabilities in CERBERUS.

I only ask for your understanding in the following points:

1. Please report via the private reporting functionality in GitHub in the first instance - you can do this by going to the Security tab on the repo in GitHub. For more, read [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
2. Please allow about 14 days for me to respond - I work on this in my spare time, which I sometimes have very little of. Security issues are, however, a top priority when I do get time to work on CERBERUS.
3. During those 14 days, I ask that you do not publish the vulnerability publicly.
4. If I do not appear to make any substantive response after 14 days, feel free to publish the advisory publicly
