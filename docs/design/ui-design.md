# UI Design

The UI will be designed such that the vast majority of tasks are done from a single page. There will, however be at least one other page, for administrative use.

The main page will look broadly like this:

![Main Page UI Design](mainpage.png "Main Page UI Design")

where the tasks list will be populated once an implant is selected. The "Show Historic" checkbox will determine whether to show tasks which have already been sent to the implant.
