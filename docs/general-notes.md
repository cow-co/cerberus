# General Notes

- Deletion endpoints return *success* if the entity did not exist in the first place
  - This is documented also in the openapi documentation.
  - However, these endpoints *also* return the basic details of the deleted entity - this will be empty if the entity did not exist.
  - So if you see a `200` response, no errors, and no "deleted entity details", then you can conclude the entity did not exist. Which you may wish to flag to the user.
  - CERBERUS UI does not do this, however. It allows the non-existent-entity case to pass silently.
  - Since if you're deleting it, you didn't want it there anyway, so no worries.
- Be *very* conservative when selecting admins. They are permitted to conduct *any* operation, to include
  - Deleting implants
  - Deleting users
  - Changing users' passwords
  - Changing users' groups
  - Changing access groups for implants
- Versioning is somewhat based on semantic versioning:
  - Version numbers aare of form `X.Y.Z`
  - `X` is the major version, indicating
    - Major functionality changes
    - Core architecture changes
    - Breaking (ie. backwards-incompatible) changes to the API
  - `Y` is the minor version, indicating
    - Additions/Backwards-compatible changes to the API
    - DB Schema changes that are transparent to external users
    - General UI spruce-ups/tweaks
  - `Z` is the patch version, indicating
    - Dependency updates
    - Changes to documentation, comments, etc
    - Refactors that don't change functionality
    - ie. a new patch version generally indicates that no functionality is changed
