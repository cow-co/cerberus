C2/UI server for administering implants as part of the RICE BOWL suite.

## Disclaimery Type Things

- Do not use this for illegal purposes 
- Do not use the RICE BOWL suite (of which this is a part) against targets/infrastructure you do not own or have express written permission to use it against
- I accept no liability for any damage the use of my tools might cause. 

## Notes for Supporting the System

See [docs/support-notes.md](docs/support-notes.md) for information that can help those who need to support and maintain live instances of CERBERUS.

## Assorted TODO items

- [ ] Got to keep the openapi docs up to date
- [ ] Got to clean up some interfaces
